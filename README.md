OhmConnect operates as both an energy management program and retail electricity provider in Texas, creating a dual approach to lowering bills. The California program alerts participants via email and SMS approximately once weekly when electricity prices spike during peak demand, encouraging temporary usage reduction. Users who successfully decrease consumption during these "OhmHours" earn rewards redeemable for gift cards, PayPal cash, or entries into prize drawings including trips and major appliances. The collective savings from all participants gets aggregated and sold back to California's grid operator, funding the rewards program.

Smart home integration amplifies savings by automatically powering down connected thermostats, smart plugs, and other devices during expensive peak periods without requiring manual intervention. The Texas electricity offering combines affordable locked-in rates with exclusive rewards—the more energy saved, the more earned. Free enrollment removes barriers to entry, with users only needing to connect utility accounts for tracking. Support team assistance via email helps navigate app features and reward redemption.

The community-driven approach creates environmental benefits by reducing grid strain during high-demand periods, potentially keeping dirty backup power plants offline while improving neighborhood air quality. OhmConnect serves California residents seeking both bill savings and rewards for conservation efforts, plus Texans wanting electricity plans that actively reward efficiency rather than penalizing it. The program works best for households with flexible energy usage patterns and smart device ecosystems enabling automated participation.

Energy Ogre functions as a fearless consumer advocate with zero financial ties to retail electricity providers, ensuring completely unbiased plan recommendations based purely on customer savings potential. The service evaluates over 1,000 electricity plans from 100+ providers continuously, checking rates every 15 minutes year-round to identify opportunities traditional shoppers miss. This constant monitoring uncovers exclusive plans unavailable on public comparison sites like Power to Choose, giving members access to hidden deals.

The $10 monthly subscription covers complete electricity management from initial plan selection through enrollment, ongoing monitoring, issue resolution with providers, and automatic switching when better options emerge. Energy Ogre compares historical household usage against currently available plans, cross-referencing consumption patterns to predict actual costs rather than relying on advertised rates that hide fees.

For Texans overwhelmed by deregulated electricity market complexity, Energy Ogre eliminates decision fatigue and ensures continuous optimization. The hands-off approach suits busy professionals, elderly residents struggling with comparison shopping, and anyone frustrated by variable rates that spike unexpectedly. However, the service exclusively serves Texas ERCOT territory, leaving residents of other states needing alternative solutions. Those comfortable navigating Power to Choose independently may find the subscription unnecessary, but most users report time savings and superior results justify the modest monthly fee.
